# Project2
# SSV -Travel Planning 

This is a trip planning app, which is named after all 3 contributors' initials: Sarah, Sharry and Viktoriya. The theme-based app would help clients search for the ideal destinations with the lowest airfare. 

The user needs to choose from the drop-down list "what would you like to do?", along with the departure/return dates and the "flying from" airport.

When the clients submit their inputs on the homepage, the app will automatically redirect to the destination page, which provides the top 5 ideal destinations with the lowest airfare.

We use the test token for SABRE APIs, which is free but expires after 7 days. To get a new one, please refer to .sabreInstructions (https://github.com/sharryheb/app-ssv2/blob/master/.sabreInstructions)
